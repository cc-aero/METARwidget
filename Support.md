## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: What is METAR?**
A: METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report) is the standard format for aviation weather reporting used worldwide. It provides current conditions including wind, visibility, weather phenomena, clouds, temperature, dewpoint, and barometric pressure.

**Q: How often does the widget update?**
A: The widget refreshes every 30 minutes, which matches the typical METAR publication schedule from airports worldwide.

**Q: Which airports are supported?**
A: All airports with ICAO codes (4-letter international codes) are supported. Examples include EGLL (London Heathrow), KJFK (New York JFK), LFPG (Paris Charles de Gaulle).

**Q: Why do I see raw METAR text instead of decoded weather?**
A: This is intentional. The app displays raw METAR reports exactly as pilots receive them, allowing for professional interpretation of conditions.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My widget shows "No METAR available"**
A: This can happen if:
- The airport code is incorrect (check it's a valid 4-letter ICAO code)
- The airport doesn't publish METAR reports
- There's a temporary network issue
- The airport is currently not reporting

**Q: The widget isn't updating**
A: Try these steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Open the main app to trigger a refresh
3. Remove and re-add the widget
4. Restart your device if the issue persists

**Q: I can't find my local airport**
A: Make sure you're using the ICAO code (4 letters), not the IATA code (3 letters). You can find ICAO codes on aviation websites or by searching "[your airport] ICAO code".

**Q: The widget appears blank**
A: This usually indicates:
- No internet connection
- Invalid airport code
- Widget needs time to load after first setup (wait 1-2 minutes)
